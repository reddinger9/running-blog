<p>I'm basically just a normal guy who one day wanted to run a half marathon because I was tired of not doing shit. I had recently started taking on things I hated doing (like walking and biking in the dead of winter) just to build fortitude because I work in a government cube farm where my biggest challenge is not to check Twitter every 10 minutes. So I thought: "What do I hate doing more than anything in life?" And that answer was running.</p>

<p>Because really, it is the worst. I had always been athletic, but I had not done an actual run of more than two miles since gym class in high school. I legitimately had done less than five one-mile runs in the last 10 years. I smoked about 10,000 more cigs than miles I had run. There were years when I drank more Keystone Light and lager than water, not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Also, I always felt self-conscious about exercising. I felt I didn't look cool doing it. So I HATED going to the gym, or just exercising in public. (I don't know where this came from, it's weird, I know). In fact when I actually got fitted for running shoes a couple months ago and they analyzed my gait, I had a hard time running on the treadmill cause I had probably only been on one a couple times in my life.</p>

<p>All that to say, in October of 2014 I had a weird cancer/growth scare where I basically was told I had a sizable mass on my pancreas by two doctors, which meant I could die real soon or incur some other not-enjoyable outcomes down the line. Except when they went to find it, it wasn't there. I guess it was a wakeup call from God that I needed to start living. And living meant being more than who I had been for years. My last cigarette was on Halloween, dressed as Joe Dirt, a Van Halen 80's world-tour t-shirt on, some bottle rockets in my pocket, and a bunch of whiskey in my stomach. I still love all of those things and hope to God there's a carton of cigs waiting for me at the pearly gates, cause I'm not even gonna lie, sometimes I'll be running and pass someone fishing on the water while having a cig and damn do I miss that.</p>

<p>Anyway, about a year later I decided I wanted to run a half marathon. I googled “half marathon training plan”, ignored the plans that were stupid complicated (i.e. weird cross-training workouts every third day after a new moon), made a table in Microsoft Word, taped it to my fridge and crossed off the boxes with a green highlighter over 14 weeks.</p>

<p>The first weeks were as bad as always, but it got better and better, and much to my surprise, I really started enjoying it.</p>

<p>And then I ran my first half in December of 2015. I keep running them and plan on running a full sometime soon. But maybe I'll just end up getting really into something on Netflix too, who knows. </p>

<p>So I want this site to be my story, but I want it to be other stories. I want it to be for the people who look like baby giraffes that just got off a carousel when they run. Or those who wear cut-off t-shirts and basketball shorts for their long runs. Who aren't so concerned about looking like they jumped off an Under Armour billboard, but who maybe smoke too much, drink too much, and think a diet is eating less than three times a week at Chick-Fil-A. Those things will probably get better as the miles go along, but it's okay if they don't. </p>

<p>I want it to be for normcore runners everywhere.</p>

<p>See you out there, on the track, the trail, or passed out and dying on the side of a road.</p>
